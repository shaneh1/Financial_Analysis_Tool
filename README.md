# Financial_Analysis_Tool
Financial Analysis tool which can analyse any company from the NASDAQ using different statistical measures and graph
Developed this tool as part of a college project with two of my classmates. Once the user has selected a company and a date range, the data is fetched
from yahoo finance. From here, the user can select a number of different statistical measures and graphs to aid them in their
analysis of their company.
The user can also make a prediction on the share price based on a simple linear regressison model.
MasterMenu.py is the main script of the tool. It imports functions from the two other files in an attempt to reduce the numbe of lines in the main file.
