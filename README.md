# Financial_Analysis_Tool
Financial Analysis tool which can analyse any company from the NASDAQ using different statistical measures and graph
Developed this tool as part of a college project with two of my classmates. Once the user has selected a company and a date range, the data is fetched
from yahoo finance. From here, the user can select a number of different statistical measures and graphs to aid them in their
analysis of their company.
The user can also make a prediction on the share price based on a simple linear regressison model.
